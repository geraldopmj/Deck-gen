# Deck-gen

Repository for a deck generator made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

Each time the page is reloaded a new deck is generated!

A friend asked me to create a software that creates a deck with
random values avoiding repetition for a board game he is creating.

Each card has 4 slots that can have 5 different types of terrain.
